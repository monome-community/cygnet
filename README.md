# cygnet

written by stetta

cygnet is a real-time eight-track performance recorder. Notes are mapped to the surface of the 256 like fourths or mabalhabla.  A foot pedal from a MIDI controller is required to start and stop the loop recording. A MIDI CC controller can also be used to record velocity or additional performance data into a track.
